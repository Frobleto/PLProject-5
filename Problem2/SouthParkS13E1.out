13,1,Cartman,"Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?
"
13,1,Stan,"I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.
"
13,1,Kyle,"Yeah, it's just so astounding.
"
13,1,Cartman,"Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened.  Kenny has a girlfriend.
"
13,1,Craig,"Yeah, a fifth-grade girlfriend.
"
13,1,Kyle,"This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
"
13,1,Jimmy,"Well, so, w-who is she?
"
13,1,Cartman,"Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
"
13,1,Butters,"Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!
"
13,1,Stan,"What?
"
13,1,Butters,"Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!
"
13,1,Stan,"Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.
"
13,1,Butters,"Um, does Kenny like her?
"
13,1,Kyle,"I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.
"
13,1,Butters,"Oh, no. Oh, geez!
"
13,1,Cartman,"Butters, what's the problem?
"
13,1,Butters,"Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
"
13,1,Kyle,"What?!
"
13,1,Butters,"It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!
"
13,1,Cartman,"That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!
"
13,1,Jimmy,"Well, Kenny deserves to know, fellas. If you guys found out my girlfriend was a raging whore, I'd want you to t-tell me.
"
13,1,Stan,"All right, come on, guys.
"
13,1,Butters,"Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?
"
13,1,Girl 1,"So, anyway, I passed him a note, but then Johnny...
"
13,1,Stan,"Kenny! Hey, hey, Kenny!
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Oh, hi, guys.)
"
13,1,Stan,"Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(What about her?)
"
13,1,Stan,"Oh, boy.
"
13,1,Kyle,"Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...
"
13,1,Kenny,"(But what?)
"
13,1,Kyle,"W-well, we've heard that she's...
"
13,1,Cartman,"Kenny.  Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Huh?)
"
13,1,Cartman,"Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, hey, yay!)
"
13,1,Cartman,"He took it pretty well.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Hey, Tammy!)
"
13,1,Tammy,"Hi, Ken. You decide what you wanna do after school?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)
"
13,1,Tammy,"TGI Friday's?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yep. I like the food!)
"
13,1,Tammy,"Yeah, okay. But...  Kenny. Listen. Uh, there's somethin' I need to talk to you about. There's a lot of rumors goin' around about me, that I agreed to give a boy a B.J.? Well, it's true.  But it was before you and I were together, and it wasn't my fault!  See, I was watchin' the Disney Channel, and that show came on with the Jonas Brothers.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Jonas Brothers?)
"
13,1,Tammy,"You know that teenage boy band? Every time I see them I get so tingly. I just completely lose control.  And then Dave Darsky showed up and took me to TGI Friday's,  and it just happened. But it was only for one second, and I had my eyes closed. I know it's terrible. Can you... can you forgive me, Ken?
"
13,1,Clerk,"There you are, young man. Two tickets to the Jonas Brothers concert.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Thanks.)
"
13,1,Cartman,"The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you?
"
13,1,Kyle,"Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)
"
13,1,Stan,"A B.J.?
"
13,1,Kyle,"You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Of course, dude!)
"
13,1,Cartman,"Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!
"
13,1,Stan,"Yeah, dude, that's gross.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.)
"
13,1,Kyle,"What kind of protection?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(I'd like a box of condoms, please.)
"
13,1,Clerk 2,"Box of condoms. Certainly, little boy. What kind would you like?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Uhm, I'll take one of those.)
"
13,1,Clerk 2,"These here? Why, certainly.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Cool!)
"
13,1,Kyle,"Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)
"
13,1,Cartman,"Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yep! Woo-hoo!)
"
13,1,Tammy,"Go, baby! Whoooo! Kenny, you're the best for bringing me here. Isn't this awesome?
"
13,1,Joe Jonas,"I'm ready to get it on. But there's no gettin' on until I'm ready. Too soon, slow down. Take it easy, oh, my girl, I need your love. Bay-bay!
"
13,1,Jonas Brothers,"I can't wait till the day I kiss you. Until then I have to tease you. 'Cause my mom doesn't like it when I'm naughty. She'll make me clean my room if I'm naughty.
"
13,1,Joe,"Bay-bay! I'm hot.
"
13,1,Nick Jonas,"He's hot.
"
13,1,Little Girl,"My 'giney tickles!
"
13,1,Tammy,"Oh, my God. It's that tingling again.  I love you!
"
13,1,Joe,"Tell me how was I to know?
"
13,1,Jonas Brothers,"You'd take your love and go.
"
13,1,Joe,"Was it 'cause I wanted to wait till we were married...
"
13,1,Jonas Brothers,"To put my arm around you?
"
13,1,Joe,"The seasons change.
"
13,1,Kevin Jonas,"Bay-bay!
"
13,1,Joe,"And the world goes round.
"
13,1,Nick,"The world goes round and round and round.
"
13,1,Jonas Brothers,"Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna take my time. Can't wait 'til you are mine, but it might be a while. 'Cause, yeah yeah, girl, we can take it slow, so we have room to grow. And then someday we can get it on. Until then, go back to Montreal.
"
13,1,Joe,"'Cause I still love you, bay-bay!
"
13,1,Nick,"Love you, bay-bay!
"
13,1,Kevin,"Bay-bay!
"
13,1,Tammy,"Whoooooo!  Aaah-oww!  You're so hot, Kevin! I love you, Joe!
"
13,1,The Jonas Brothers,"Good night, Denver. We love you all!  We love you, Denver!  Good night!
"
13,1,Tammy,"Oh, my God, I am so worked up! I just want to attack you, Kenny!
"
13,1,Kenny,"(All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!)
"
13,1,Usher,"And, uh, you too, little girl in the red.
"
13,1,Tammy,"Huh?
"
13,1,Usher,"Band would like you to come backstage. You, too, little girl in the puppy T-shirt.
"
13,1,Tammy,"They want me to come backstage? Oh, my God!
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Look, they're nothing, but...)
"
13,1,Tammy,"It's a dream come true!
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Hey!)
"
13,1,Usher,"All right, right this way, girls.
"
13,1,Roadie,"Yeah, come on in everyone. The band is waiting for you.  Uh, not you.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Hey, that's not fair! I got the fucking ticket!)  (Hey! What the heck!)
"
13,1,Roadie 2,"The Jonas Brothers will be right out, girls.
"
13,1,Girl in Puppy T-shirt,"Why do you think they called us back here?
"
13,1,Fat Girl,"They must've wanna have sex with us.
"
13,1,Tammy,"What? You think so?
"
13,1,Fat Girl,"Sure, they're a band. They called us back here so we can give them blowjobs.
"
13,1,Girl in Puppy T-shirt,"Well, I'm not doing it! Just 'cause they're rock stars doesn't mean I'll do that!
"
13,1,Girl in O T-shirt,"Yeah, I'm not giving a blowjob to anybody!
"
13,1,Tammy,"Me neither.
"
13,1,Jonas Brothers,"Hey, there, girls!
"
13,1,Joe,"Hey, listen, we saw you out there in the audience.
"
13,1,Nick,"Yeah, you were getting a little crazy out there.
"
13,1,Fat Girl,"Let's just get to the blowjobs.
"
13,1,Joe,"Blow what?
"
13,1,Kevin,"I don't know.  Look, we called you back here because we want to share our love of Christ with you
"
13,1,Nick,"And see if you'll wear purity rings from now on.
"
13,1,Tammy,"Purity rings?
"
13,1,Joe,"We all wear purity rings. It means we are going to be pure and not have sex until we're married.
"
13,1,Kevin,"And it means we stay away from bad stuff and avoid people who swear and watch naughty TV shows.
"
13,1,Nick,"That's just how we roll.
"
13,1,Kevin,"Yeah.
"
13,1,Nick,"Yeah.
"
13,1,Joe,"So, what do ya say, girls? You wanna be kid hipsters like us and wear purity rings too?
"
13,1,The Girls,"Okay.
"
13,1,Kevin,"And be sure to give a ring to all the kids you care about, 'cause it's the hip new way to roll.
"
13,1,Cartman,"Well well well, here he comes. It's BJ McKay and his best friend Bear.
"
13,1,Stan,"So how did it go last night?
"
13,1,Kyle,"What's that?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(A purity ring.)
"
13,1,Cartman,"Purity ring?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah, it's a purity ring.)
"
13,1,Kyle,"...Well, what does that mean?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)
"
13,1,Stan,"Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-
"
13,1,Kenny,"(I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)
"
13,1,Kyle,"Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah.)  (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...)
"
13,1,Butters,"Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
"
13,1,Kyle,"Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.
"
13,1,Butters,"Uh, what's that?
"
13,1,Stan,"They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.
"
13,1,Butters,"Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring?
"
13,1,Purity Boy 1,"Yeah, we found out that once you wear purity rings, it's best to hang out with other couples that do. Got more in common. Isn't that right, Sarah?
"
13,1,Purity Boy 2,"You know? What Carole and I enjoy is Grey's Anatomy. We love Grey's Anatomy, don't we, Carole?
"
13,1,Purity Boy 3,"We adore Grey's Anatomy, don't we, Nancy?
"
13,1,Nancy,"Adore it. Kenny and Tammy, do you watch Grey's Anatomy?
"
13,1,Purity Boy 1,"We look forward to it all week long.
"
13,1,Purity Boy 3,"Sure is sweet.
"
13,1,Purity Boy 1,"It's the most fun I've had in weeks.
"
13,1,Jonas Brothers,"I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do. What I cannot do. Bay... bay... Baaay... Baybay. Baybay. Baaaybaaaaay.
"
13,1,Director,"Aaand cut. Great video shoot, guys.
"
13,1,Joe,"This is bullpucky!
"
13,1,Kevin,"Yeah, we've had it, Goshdarnit!
"
13,1,Director,"Uh oh, looks like we've got a problem.
"
13,1,Joe,"Our decision is final! We have decided, as a band, not to wear purity rings anymore!
"
13,1,Kevin,"Yeah, you tell 'em, Joe.
"
13,1,Disney Exec 1,"Boys, I know you're tired, but the purity rings are important to the company's image.
"
13,1,Joe,"We don't care about the company.
"
13,1,Director,"And you're gonna say that to the boss's face?
"
13,1,Kevin,"We aren', we aren't afraid of him.
"
13,1,Disney Exec 2,"Well, I hope you're right, because the boss is on his way here. Now.
"
13,1,Disney Exec 3,"Oh Jesus, he's here. The boss is here!
"
13,1,Kevin,"Let's be strong, guys.
"
13,1,Disney Exec 3,"Hello sir. How was your trip?
"
13,1,Mickey,"What's all this I'm hearing about not wearing the purity rings, haha?
"
13,1,Director,"Uh we'll just leave you alone.
"
13,1,Mickey,"So uh, I guess we have some issues, haha?
"
13,1,Kevin,"We... need to talk about something.
"
13,1,Mickey,"Oh boy! I just love flying all the way to Colorado to hear about your problems, haha.
"
13,1,Joe,"Look, we just want our concerts to be about our music, and not about purity rings.
"
13,1,Mickey,"Oh Gosh, fellas, let me explain this to you one more time. You have to wear the purity rings because that's how we can sell sex to little girls, haha. See, if we make the posters with little girls reaching for your junk, then you have to wear purity rings or else Disney Company looks baaad, haha.
"
13,1,Joe,"Well we don't wanna be selling sex to little girls anymore.
"
13,1,Mickey,"The rings stay on!
"
13,1,Joe,"Well, well, maybe we'll just refuse to go onstage.
"
13,1,Mickey,"You don't... Fucking..Talk to me. Like that, haha. You little... piece of... shit, Haha!  Get the fuck up. Get the fuck up! Haha.  Now, do we have a problem?! Haha.
"
13,1,Nick,"No, sir.
"
13,1,Kevin,"No, Mr. Mouse.
"
13,1,Joe,"No, Mr. Mouse.
"
13,1,Mickey,"Oh, that's good, 'cause I thought we had a problem for a minute there, haha.  Alright now, get out there and make me some Goddamned money! Haha.
"
13,1,Kyle,"Yup, he's in here.
"
13,1,Stan,"Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!
"
13,1,Kyle,"We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Look at this. More DVDs.)
"
13,1,Cartman,"Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!
"
13,1,Stan,"Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.
"
13,1,Cartman,"Kenny? Kenny?  Kenny?  Wanna look at Playboy?  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?
"
13,1,Stan,"You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Oh, Grey's Anatomy. Cool! Oh man, this is a great DVD. We're gonna have the ... sex, yeah.)
"
13,1,Stan,"You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.
"
13,1,Kyle,"It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.
"
13,1,Cartman,"Oh my God, look at this!  Motherfucker!
"
13,1,Stan,"What?
"
13,1,Cartman,"""Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings."" These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this!
"
13,1,Kyle,"Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!
"
13,1,Stan,"All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die!
"
13,1,Kyle,"Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah...)
"
13,1,Announcer,"Live from Five News Studio in Colorado, it's Good Mornin' Denver.
"
13,1,Host,"We are joined this morning by the Disney supergroup the Jonas Brothers. Hello boys.
"
13,1,Joe,"Hello.
"
13,1,Host,"Now, tell us what you're doin' here in Denver, guys.
"
13,1,Joe,"Uh, we're gonna be doin' a live concert from Red Rocks tonight that will be live-broadcast on the Disney Channel.
"
13,1,Mickey,"In 3-D. Don't forget to mention in 3-D.
"
13,1,Kevin,"Oh, oh-and it's gonna be in 3-D.
"
13,1,Host,"Now, guys, a lot has been made about your ""purity rings"". Can you tell us about those?
"
13,1,Joe,"Well. Um.  We, we wear these to symbolize how pure we are and how we ...um don't approve of things that are naughty or filthy.
"
13,1,Mickey,"Yeah, that's good. Get a close-up on their purity rings. Close-up on the purity rings, haha.
"
13,1,Host,"That's wonderful, boys.  It's good that little girls can see a concert and not have it be about sex. We understand that at the concert tonight you'll be dousing girls in the audience with white foam. Is that correct?
"
13,1,Nick,"Uh huh.
"
13,1,Joe,"Yeah. Uh huh.
"
13,1,Kevin,"Yeah.
"
13,1,Nick,"Yeah.
"
13,1,Host,"Well can you give our audience a peek?  What do you say girls? Do you want the Jonas Brothers to douse you with their white foam?
"
13,1,Mickey,"Oh boy! This is TV gold, haha.
"
13,1,Stan,"Excuse us. Excuse us.
"
13,1,Girl 2,"Hey, what do you think you're doing?!
"
13,1,Host,"That's great stuff, boys. You like takin' the Jonas Brothers' hot foam in your faces, girls?
"
13,1,Cartman,"Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!
"
13,1,Stan,"Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!
"
13,1,Joe,"Huh?
"
13,1,Kyle,"What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!
"
13,1,Mickey,"Who the hell are these guys?  Are they from DreamWorks? Goddamn Eisner trying to hurt this company again, haha?
"
13,1,Cartman,"This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  teh- ...tehhhh
"
13,1,Kyle,"Cartman?
"
13,1,Mickey,"You aren't ruining my plans this time, DreamWorks, haha!
"
13,1,Stan,"Dude, who the hell did that?  Hwa?
"
13,1,Kyle,"Dow...
"
13,1,Voice 1,"Fifteen minutes, that's fifteen minutes, people!
"
13,1,Voice 2,"Get another mic on that dronk kid.
"
13,1,Mickey,"They almost ruined everything, haha. How did something like this happen, haha?  Wake up. Wake up, you little prick! Haha.  Who do you work for? DreamWorks?  Answer me, haha!
"
13,1,Stan,"We... don't work for any-body.
"
13,1,Mickey,"Oh boy, I sure believe that, haha.  You just tried to ruin Disney Company's big night for your own amusement, huh?! Haha.
"
13,1,Cartman,"The hell did you do to us?!
"
13,1,Mickey,"SHUT UP!  Haha.
"
13,1,Announcer,"And now, Disney Channel presents... the Jonas Brothers 3-D concert spectacular!  Live from Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado!
"
13,1,Male Host,"Truly a night of magic as we're set for the biggest concert event of the year!
"
13,1,Female Host,"In about ten minutes, the Jonas Brothers are going to take the stage in what Disney is calling ""the most pure and innocent rock event of the millennia.""
"
13,1,Blonde Girl,"Do we put the 3-D glasses on now, da-da?
"
13,1,Father,"Not yet, Katie.
"
13,1,Male Host,"Everyone around the country is tuning in to see Disney's latest kid pop stars.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(And not getting a blowjob...)
"
13,1,Male Host,"We understand the Jonas Brothers are getting ready. What's going on backstage must be exciting.
"
13,1,Mickey,"You'd better start talkin', haha!  You'd better start talkin' right now, haha!
"
13,1,Stan,"We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
"
13,1,Kyle,"We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
"
13,1,Mickey,"You're lying! I'll cut you up, haha!
"
13,1,Joe,"You see? We were right about the purity rings! A nice Christian symbol can't be used for profit gains.
"
13,1,Kevin,"We've all angered God.
"
13,1,Mickey,"You think God is in control here, haha?! I am in control! I've been in control since the '50s in case you haven't noticed, haha!  You three faggots are going onstage, and  YOU three faggots aren't going to stop me! NOBODY IS RUINING THIS EVENT!! Haha. I've worked too long and too hard to have anybody  fuck this up!  Where would you be without me, Jonas Brothers? Haha. Your music sucks and you know it! Haha. It's because you make little girls' 'ginies tickle! And when little girls' 'ginies tickle, I make money! Haha. And that's because little girls are fucking stupid! Haha. And the purity rings make it okay to do whatever I want! Haha. Even the Christians are too fucking stupid to figure out I'm selling sex to their daughters! I've made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now, haha! And do you know why?!  Because Christians are retard-ed! Haha.  They believe in a talking dead guy! Haha.  Ohhh. Haha. Hello, folks.
"
13,1,Audience,"BOOO!!
"
13,1,Mickey,"Now now, take it easy, haha. Here's the Jonas Brothers.
"
13,1,Joe,"Come on guys.
"
13,1,Mickey,"No! Stop! Bring them back here!
"
13,1,Roadie,"It's over, Mr. Mouse. Everyone's tuning out.
"
13,1,Mickey,"NO! NO GODDAMNIT! NO! SHUT UP! SHUT! UP! AAAAAAGH!
"
13,1,Father,"That's it girls. No more Disney TV for a while.
"
13,1,Reporter,"Tom, the Disney Jonas Brothers 3D Television Special has failed, costing the Disney Company millions, and once again Mickey is pissed off and throwing a fit.
"
13,1,Mickey,"Vengeance is mine! You are all ants and I am your destroyer, haha.
"
13,1,Reporter,"The Disney purity ring venture will now most likely prove a marketing bust, as Mickey returns to Valhalla to slumber and feed.
"
13,1,Tammy,"Aw Ken, look what we've become. We're way too young to be this boring.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(I agree. Let's put in this DVD and watch Grey's Anatomy.)
"
13,1,Tammy,"No! I don't want to watch Grey's Anatomy, Ken. Let's take off these rings, Ken.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??)  (Really?)
"
13,1,Tammy,"Let's take them off and just be kids again. There'll be plenty of time to wear rings and be boring and lame when we reach our late 30s and we're boring and lame anyway.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah. Screw this crap!)
"
13,1,Tammy,"Oh I feel better already!
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Me too!)
"
13,1,Tammy,"What say you and me... go to T.G.I. Fridays?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Woo-hoo!!)
"
